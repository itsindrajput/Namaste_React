This is a very useful Mantra 🙏

✔ React.createElement
It ends up being a Javascript object, the render method takes this object as input and converts it to HTML elements and puts it into DOM.

✔ JSX
This is not HTML inside Javascript and this is HTML like syntax.
Babel 🚀 (powerful Javascript library) will convert JSX into React.createElement and at the end it becomes an object again.

✔ Functional Component
Functional components are just normal Javascript functions and it returns some piece of JSX, nothing else 😀

✔ Class Component
These are normal Javascript classes which extend React.component (provided by react) to make the normal class as react component. It has render() method to return some piece of JSX.

✔ React Hooks
No need to panic about react hooks at all, these are also normal Javascript functions. We can have our hooks as well.

✔ React Context
Context is used to store some data which we need all across our application.
Context also a function which is created using createContext function.

✔ Flow of the application behind the scene
JSX ➡️ React.createElement ➡️ Object ➡️ rendered as HTML into DOM
